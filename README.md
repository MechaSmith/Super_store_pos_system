**INTRODUCTION**

The following section provides an overview of the derived Software Requirements Specification 
(SRS) for the subject Food Store Management System. To begin with, the purpose of the document is presented and its intended audience outlined. Subsequently, the scope of the project specified by the document is given with a particular focus on what the resultant software will do and the relevant benefits associated with it. The nomenclature used throughout the SRS is also offered. To conclude, a complete document overview is provided to facilitate increased reader comprehension and navigation.

Under this project, an Inventory Control System for “Super City” Mega Food Store will be developed into a partially automated Food Store. Currently the above-mentioned food store depends upon a manually managed system which has caused them to face number of problems, mainly having a big deal of paper work to do, eventually leading to inefficiency, security issues and management problems. Also one of the major priorities that count in a food store is the duration of the food products.
The Super City mega food store had transferred into a new premise with a higher Food Item capacity and now because of that the demand for an efficient way to manage the Food store is as high as it has ever been so implement a system that will take the strain of a high Food Item volume from the staff members and will help them to manage the food store better.
The proposed system for the “Super City”  Mega food store will manage most of the data on the store and will automate some of the more tiring and labor consuming tasks off the hand of the staff and make time for them to do the tasks that are absolutely necessary of the attention of the staff. Mainly the proposed system covers the,

- Food Item’s registering.
-	Registering Employees.
-	Food Item enrolment and management.
-	Employee management.
-	Archiving valuable details for future usage.
-	User management.
-	Generate reports for necessary instances.
-	Notifying parents about the arrival of the students to the class.
-	Implement a system to identify the students who are not paying the fees and are attending the wrong class. 
-	Placing purchase orders.
-	Maintaining the system.


**Product Scope** 

In current formal selecting environments, some form of physical static is utilized to convey the available food and beverage choices to customers. Item lists are generally paper based and hence impose restrictions on the textual real estate available and the ability store has to update them. This document specifies the requirements for a Mega food store and ordering replacement strategy to alleviate the problems associated with the current archaic method. It should be noted that while the suggested strategy incorporates the use of various hardware components, the primary focus of the presented SRS relates to the constituent software elements.

The main scope is managing the Food items which are being stored and sold. Most of the processes done by the Food Store is partially automated in this system as something as precious as the future of our country should never be handled without the human consent. The limitations of the software are registering of the food item batches, Registering food items, categorizing, employment registration. Furthermore the enrolling and banishing any Food item from the Food Store falls to the client as for his request. The user privileges of the software are managed by the client and he have the ability to assign and take away access to the system from the users.

This system is developed in a spiral architecture and the system in this stage will prioritise in the Food management section. Hence the attendance of the employees are managed and handled in this software all the salary payments are also automated. However the payments of the institute is somewhat handled by the software in order to achieve the main goal of making the Food Store function efficiently.
